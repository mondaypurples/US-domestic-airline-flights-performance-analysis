Requirements to create the expected result:
- Two dropdown menus: For choosing report type and year
- Each dropdown will be designed as follows:
    - An outer division with two inner divisions (as shown in the expected layout)
    - One of the inner divisions will have information about the dropdown and the other one is dropdown.
- Layout for adding graphs.
- Callback function to compute data, create graph and return to the layout.

Project Environment: Utilized Cloud IDE Theia, Python runtime to create and launch your Dash applications.
